    Eyes dilated from staring at memories
    <br />
    Leaking through a fractured picture frame
    <br />
    I can't trust who I am or the people around me
    <br />
    Beyond the point of no return
    <br />
    <br />
    Cold winds creep through blackout curtains
    <br />
    Bed sheets suffocate
    <br />
    The world is without color, nothing can change that
    <br />
    Turn out the lights
    <br />
    Turn out the lights
    <br />
    <br />
    Please answer the phone
    <br />
    Your friends are worried about you
    <br />
    If you surrender to this torment
    <br />
    The pain will never end
    <br />
    <br />
    Distractions are useless
    <br />
    Scars are the only thing that I have left
    <br />
    Distractions are useless
    <br />
    With hands smashed and broken
    <br />
    <br />
    Eyes rolled back, memories dismembered
    <br />
    Severing mind and body
    <br />
    Detached and disconnected, pleading for release
    <br />
    Scars are the only thing left
    <br />
    <br />
    I hate to say it
    <br />
    I hate to say it
    <br />
    I hate to say it
    <br />
    I hate to say it
    <br />
    <br />
    Pleading for release
    <br />
    Pleading for release
    <br />
    For release
    <br />
    For release
    <br />
    Pleading for release
    <br />
    <br />
    When I finally burn out bright
    <br />
    God will laugh in my face
    <br />
    <br />
    Mockingly, it was worthless in the end
    <br />
    Worthless all along
    <br />
    For no one is listening
    <br />
    I hate to say it
    <br />
    But you knew that all along
